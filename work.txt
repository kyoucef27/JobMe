II-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE USING GROQ
    I-NON PAID FEATURES
        moderation:
        -Detect fake reviews / spam accounts using behavioral anomaly detection.

        -AI-Assisted Customer Support
        Chatbot for FAQs (payment, disputes, deadlines).
        Context-aware support that escalates when needed.



        for buyers:
        -Semantic search / AI ranking: Instead of keyword matching (“logo design”), use embeddings to match intent. 
        (e.g., user writes “I need a playful mascot logo” → model finds designers with a style close to that).
        
        -Recommendation engine: “You may also like” gigs/freelancers, based on buyer history or similarity of gigs.
        -Let buyers describe their needs to a chatbot instead of filling forms. Bot turns it into a structured gig request.


        for sellers:
        -“Smart pricing” suggestions for freelancers based on historical data.
        -Demand forecasting: show what skills are trending.
